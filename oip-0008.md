## Abstract

An extension of Obyte consensus protocol is proposed which allows burning Bytes. It introduces a standard way to provably burn Bytes and can be used by sidechains attached to Obyte.

## Copyright

## Motivation

Some applications may need to provably burn Bytes to compete for something, such that the party that burns more, wins something.

The main type of applications we are targeting is sidechains. For example, sidechains that are blockchains could leverage the ordering capability of Obyte to order their blocks instead of relying on their own consensus mechanisms (which are prone to centralization and vulnerable to censorship, especially when the chains are small). The blockchains can be based on any technology, such as EVM, Solana, etc, but would track Obyte for their consensus. They would post the full content of their blocks to Obyte as `temp_data` ([OIP 7](oip-0007.md)), and in case of a fork (several competing blocks at the same block height), it can be resolved by a combination of the blocks's relative order on the Obyte DAG and the amount burned by a block producer, such that the block that is posted within a certain time frame and burns most Bytes, wins.

While Bytes can already be burned by sending them to a non-spendable address, none of such addresses makes it evident that it is non-spendable (e.g. looks like all zeros) and different users might user different burning addresses, which makes it harder to see what is burned. So, it would be great to have a single "right" way of burning.

## Specification

1. Add a new optional field `burn_fee` to unit JSON:
```
"burn_fee": 12345,
```
The unit must pay for the `burn_fee`, i.e.
```
(sum of all inputs in Bytes) = (sum of all outputs in Bytes) + (standard size-based fees) + oversize_fee + tps_fee + burn_fee + (other fees)
```

2. If not specified, the burn fee is assumed to be 0.

3. AAs cannot pay the burn fee.

4. The above rules start applying to units whose last ball MCI is after a specific upgrade MCI (which will be set to a value well in the future to give all nodes enough time to upgrade).



## Rationale

The proposed change enables block producers in sidechains to compete for the right to produce the next block by posting the proposed block to Obyte as `temp_data` within a certain time frame and at the same time burning some Bytes. The block whose transaction burned most Bytes, would win (if it is valid, of course).

Such a competition is beneficial to Byte holders as it creates demand for Bytes to be burned and reduces the circulating supply.


## Backwards compatibility

It is a breaking change and all nodes will have to upgrade before the upgrade MCI as indicated in rule 4.
