## Abstract

An extension of Obyte consensus protocol is proposed which significantly increases the fee as transaction size (in bytes) grows. This protects the network from being spammed with large transactions that could unreasonably inflate the database size required to run a full node.

This is only part of spam protection. A companion [OIP 6](oip-0006.md) addresses the threat of spamming the network with a large number of (small) transactions.

## Motivation

While the "1 byte of storage costs 1 byte of currency" model adopted by Obyte seems fair and intuitive, it doesn't provide a sufficient cost barrier to bad actors who intend to spam the network with large transactions. The attacker's motivation might be to make the storage requirements for full nodes untenable, make them drop out, reduce the number of full nodes, and make the network more centralized. With the current price of GBYTE, adding 1 GB of storage in perpetuity to all full nodes would cost only $10.

This circumstance can also occur naturally, without bad intent, if someone starts using Obyte for storing large amounts of data -- the way Obyte is not meant to be used. The consequences would be the same.

We need to make large transactions prohibitively expensive. At the same time, we want to keep the simple "1 byte of storage = 1 byte of currency" rule for the vast majority of normal, reasonably sized transactions meant to transfer tokens, interact with dapps, and store reasonable amounts of data used by dapps and smart contracts.


## Specification

1. We introduce an additional fee, called "oversize fee", paid by transactions whose size exceeds `threshold_size`. The threshold size is initially set to 10 kB but can be changed by governance (see below). The oversize fee is calculated as:

```
oversize_fee = size * (exp(size / threshold_size - 1) - 1)
```
where `size` is the transaction size in bytes.

The calculated amount is rounded up (`ceil()`).

2. Nothing changes for transactions smaller than `threshold_size`.

3. If a transaction pays the oversize fee, its unit JSON must include the additional `oversize_fee` field. 
```
"oversize_fee": 12345,
```
This field must be omitted in transactions smaller than `threshold_size`.

4. The oversize fee is burned.

5. AA responses pay the oversize fee like everyone else.

6. The above rules start applying to units whose last ball MCI is after a specific upgrade MCI (which will be set to a value well in the future to give all nodes enough time to upgrade).

7. Community governance can change the value of `threshold_size` using the same voting mechanism that is used to update the OP list and described in [OIP3](oip-0003.md).

8. Before the upgrade, all nodes are "pre-loaded" with votes of several high-value addresses in favor of the initial value of `threshold_size`. This means that their votes are recorded in favor of the initial `threshold_size` even though they didn't cast any vote transaction yet. They can override their votes after the upgrade is activated.



## Rationale

The proposed change makes those who send large transactions pay an exponentially growing fee. For example, a 100 kB transaction would cost 810,208,393 Bytes, i.e. 8102 times its normal fee. A 200 kB transaction would cost 35,696,459,992,638 Bytes, which is more than 35% of the entire supply of Bytes.

At the same time it doesn't affect the vast majority of users whose transactions are well below 10 kB. 

It also doesn't punish too strongly those transactions whose size exceeds 10 kB by a small number of times, which can occasionally happen for some data feed, data, or blackbytes transactions. For example, a 20 kB transaction would cost additionally 34,366 Bytes, i.e. 1.7 times its normal fee. A 40 kB transaction would cost 763,422 Bytes, or 19.1 times its normal fee.

The oversize fee is burned because it's the simplest way of handling it with the least potential of being exploited. If it were recycled by some users, we would have to be careful not to undermine the spam protection, and the recovered amounts would be small anyway. The burned fee also somewhat benefits the entire community by reducing the circulating supply of Bytes, but again we don't expect any significant amounts to be burned as the vast majority of users will never have to pay the oversize fee and the fee strongly disincentivizes large transactions.


## Backwards compatibility

It is a breaking change and all nodes will have to upgrade before the upgrade MCI as indicated in rule 6.
