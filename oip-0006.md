## Abstract

An extension of Obyte consensus protocol is proposed which significantly increases the fee as transaction flow (transactions per second) grows. This protects the network from being spammed with a large number of transactions that would exceed the processing capacity of some nodes.

This is only part of spam protection. A companion [OIP 5](oip-0005.md) addresses the threat of spamming the network with large transactions.

## Motivation

In Obyte, every transaction has to be processed by every full node. While the "1 byte of storage costs 1 byte of currency" model adopted by Obyte seems fair and intuitive, it doesn't provide a sufficient cost barrier to bad actors who intend to spam the network with a large number of transactions being consistently sent over long periods of time. The attacker's motivation might be to exceed the processing capacity of the slower full nodes, make them drop out, reduce the number of full nodes, and make the network more centralized. By increasing the TPS (transactions per second) even further, the attacker would be able to overwhelm the faster nodes too, thus crowding out the legitimate transactions, leading to long and consistently increasing confirmation times. The current maximum TPS that a laptop computer can process is about 30 TPS. Assuming 1 transaction costs the attacker roughly 1,000 Bytes in fees and they send 30 spam transactions per second, the cost of the attack would be 30 KB / sec, or 0.1 GB / hour, or 2.4 GB / day. At the current exchange rate, that would be about $20 per day.

This circumstance can also occur naturally, without bad intent, if the network becomes more actively used. The consequences would be the same.

To balance the demand for transaction processing capacity and the supply, we need to increase the fees as TPS approaches the processing capacity of the slowest targeted nodes. That would make further increase in use too costly and, in case of an attack, prevent the attacker from achieving their goals. At the same time, we want to keep the simple "1 byte of storage = 1 byte of currency" rule mostly intact for the low-activity state that we are seeing now.


## Specification

1. Allow each unit to specify an additional field `max_aa_responses`, a non-negative integer. If this unit happens to trigger an AA, this field would mean the maximum number of AA responses it is allowed to produce. Trying to produce more responses would make it bounce. If the unit triggers several AAs, the maximum applies to each of them. If the field is omitted, the default value 10 is assumed. If the unit doesn't trigger any AAs, it is not allowed to have this field. AA responses are not allowed to have this field either, even if they trigger other AAs (this field is meant for primary triggers only).

2. Define _local tps_ at any point (unit) on the DAG this way: count all new units (including the current one) added after this unit’s last ball. All these units should be included in the current unit through its main parent (best parent) but not included in the last ball unit. Non-main parents are excluded, as well as all earlier units included by non-parents but not by the main parent. Units that are AA responses are not counted. Units that are AA triggers are counted with their maximum number of responses as defined by their `max_aa_responses` (or 10 if omitted), i.e. such units are counted as `1 + max_aa_responses`. Calculate the difference between the current unit’s and the last ball unit’s timestamps. The number of units divided by the timestamp difference is the local tps at this unit.

3. Define _final tps_ for a unit as local tps of its MC unit, i.e. the unit that lies on the MC and has the same MCI as the unit in question. The MC unit necessarily includes the unit in question, or is the unit in question. Final tps is calculated after the unit stabilizes. When calculating the tps, use the same rules as in the previous rule, except using the _actual_ number of AA responses instead of `max_aa_responses`. In particular, if the unit whose final tps we are calculating is the same as its MC unit and the actual number of AA responses in all primary triggers involved is the same as `max_aa_responses`, then the unit's final tps is equal to its local tps. In general, however, the unit's final tps can be more or less than its local tps.

4. Introduce an additional fee, called "tps fee", which is calculated as:
```
tps_fee = base_tps_fee * (exp(final_tps / tps_interval) - 1)
```
where
* `final_tps` is final tps at the unit's position in the DAG as defined in the previous rule.
* `base_tps_fee` is a system-wide variable equal to 10 by default. It can be changed by governance (see below).
* `tps_interval` is a system-wide variable equal to 1 by default. It can be changed by governance (see below).

The calculated amount is rounded to the nearest integer (`round()`).

5. For each non-AA address, track a _tps fee balance_ of this address. This balance tracks the total amount prepaid for tps fees minus the actual amount paid for tps fees. All addresses start with 0 balance. The balance of an address that sent at least one transaction is supposed to be positive under most circumstances but it can occasionally be negative.

6. All units that are not AA responses must include an additional `tps_fee` field in their JSON: 
```
"tps_fee": 12345,
```
This field must be included even if the value is 0. The value must be non-negative. To calculate the required fee:
* Calculate the local tps fee using the formula in the rule 4 above but replacing final_tps with local_tps of the unit being created and without rounding.
* Calculate the _required tps fee_ by multiplying the local tps fee by `1 + max_aa_responses * (number of primary AA triggers)` (if it is an AA trigger) and by `tps_fee_multiplier`, which is another system-wide variable, 10 by default, changeable by governance (see below). Round the product.
* If the unit is authored by only one address, just subtract the tps fee balance of that address at last ball MCI from the required tps fee. If the unit is authored by several addresses, they must pay the required tps fee in the same shares as their shares in the `earned_headers_commission_recipients` field. That is, for each address, its share of the unit's `tps_fee` must be at least equal to its share of the required tps fee minus the address'es tps fee balance at last ball MCI. If `earned_headers_commission_recipients` includes at least one non-author address, then `earned_headers_commission_recipients` is overridden (for the purposes of the tps fee calculation) and the first address pays for all tps fees.

The unit's `tps_fee` field must be equal to the value calculated this way, or more. If it is smaller, the unit is invalid. If the calculated value is negative, 0 must be used.

The unit must pay for the `tps_fee`, i.e.
```
(sum of all inputs in Bytes) = (sum of all outputs in Bytes) + (standard size-based fees) + oversize_fee + tps_fee + (other fees)
```

7. When the unit stabilizes, calculate the final tps fee according to rule 4, split it among author addresses according to `earned_headers_commission_recipients` as described in rule 6, and subtract the final tps fee (or its share) from each author address'es tps fee balance. The resulting balance should be positive in most cases but it can occasionally become negative too.

8. The tps fee is burned. What is burned is the amount that is actually charged at the time of stabilization, not the `tps_fee` prepaid in the unit. The change amount stays on the tps fee balance and can be used against future tps fees.

9. The amount on the tps fee balance can be used only for paying future tps fees, it cannot be cashed out. Even if all outputs on an address are spent (i.e. it is drained to 0), its tps fee balance normally stays positive, and cannot be recovered (unless the user starts using this address again).

10. AAs don't pay tps fees and AA responses don't include the `tps_fee` field. Instead, all tps fees are paid by the trigger unit for all its AA responses.

11. Define _current tps_ as the current number of unstable units (with AA triggers counted as `1 + max_aa_responses`) divided by the difference between the current timestamp and the timestamp of the last stable unit. It is roughly what local tps would be if we were to create a new unit now, without the exception for non-main parents.

12. Define _current tps fee_ as tps fee according to rule 4 but based on current tps rather than final tps.

13. A node may temporarily reject (temp-reject) a new unit if its required tps fee as calculated by rule 6 is below some threshold. The threshold might look like 150% of current tps fee multiplied by the total number of units the current unit would produce (including AA responses). The threshold level (150%) is node specific and application of this rule depends on the node's current state. Temporary rejection means that the same unit might be accepted later when the node's state changes.

14. When creating new units, a node may exclude parents whose required tps fee as calculated by rule 6 is below some threshold. The threshold might look like 300% of current tps fee multiplied by the total number of units the parent unit would produce (including AA responses). The threshold level (300%) is node specific and application of this rule depends on the node's current state. Temporary rejection means that the same unit might be parented later when the node's state changes.

15. The above rules start applying to units whose last ball MCI is after a specific upgrade MCI (which will be set to a value well in the future to give all nodes enough time to upgrade).

16. Community governance can change the values of `base_tps_fee`, `tps_interval`, and `tps_fee_multiplier` using the same voting mechanism that is used to update the OP list and described in [OIP3](oip-0003.md).

17. Before the upgrade, all nodes are "pre-loaded" with votes of several high-value addresses in favor of the initial values of `base_tps_fee`, `tps_interval`, and `tps_fee_multiplier`. This means that their votes are recorded in favor of the initial values of these variables even though they didn't cast any vote transaction yet. They can override their votes after the upgrade is activated.



## Rationale

### TPS fee values and spam protection

The proposed change exponentially increases the fee as the load grows. Here are the tps fees for some values of tps under the formula in rule 4:

| tps | tps fee | fees per day, USD (1 GB = $10)
| --- | --- | --
| 0.03 | 0 | $0
| 0.1 | 1 | $0.00009
| 1 | 17 | $0.015
| 3 | 191 | $0.49
| 5 | 1,474 | $6.37
| 8 | 29,800 | $205.97
| 10 | 220,255 | $1,903
| 12 | 1,627,538 | $16,874
| 15 | 32,690,164 | $423,665
| 17 | 241,549,518 | $3,547,879
| 20 | 4,851,651,944 | $83,836,546
| 25 | 720,048,993,364 | $15,553,058,257

(the last numbers for fees per day are a bit nonsensical as the entire supply of Bytes would be burned faster than in one day).

The current average TPS is about 0.03, so the immediate effect of tps fees would be almost nonexistent.

### Burning
The tps fee is burned because it's the simplest way of handling it with the least potential of being exploited. If it were recycled by some users, we would have to be careful not to undermine the spam protection. The burned fee also somewhat benefits the entire community by reducing the circulating supply of Bytes.

### AAs
AAs don't pay tps fees for the transactions they send, instead the user who triggers the primary AA must pay the tps fees for all the AA responses they trigger. This is because AA developers cannot foresee the tps fees, which can vary wildly, and budget their AA for all possible cases. Instead, the initiator of the request pays, and they might decide to postpone the AA request if the current tps fees are too high.

### Size independence
The tps fee depends on the frequency of transactions, not their size, as the load created by each transaction consists primarily of multiple operations that are performed once per transaction each, and has little dependence on the transaction size.

### Final TPS vs local TPS and fee prepayment
The biggest difficulty is that the final TPS when the transaction stabilizes is not known in advance. That's why we require prepayment of 10x of the local tps fee. This minimizes the chances that the tps fee balance would turn negative after charging the final tps fee. However, this is still possible. The negative amount has to be paid back with the next transaction, and the user will have to send the next transaction if they still have non-trivial balance on the address.

Under most circumstances, when the load doesn't change too quickly, the final tps will be roughly equal to the local tps.

When an address sends its first transaction, it would have to pay 10x the local tps fee. If the final tps fee is the same as the local one, only 10% of the prepayment will be actually used and 90% will stay on the tps fee balance. The next transaction (assuming the load didn't change) will have to pay only 1 local tps fee as the tps fee balance is already sufficiently funded to cover 10x local tps fee.

However, if the user sends the second transaction before the first one stabilizes, the tps fee balance (which is determined at the last ball unit) will not be updated yet and the user would have to pay 10x the local fee again. When both transactions stabilize, the tps fee balance would be 18x local tps fee. In this case, the user might be able to send the next transaction without paying any additional tps fee as it will be fully funded from the tps fee balance.

Charging the tps fee based on the _local_ tps would be unsafe as users would be able to pay unfairly small fees by attaching to an old part of the DAG and using the current timestamp to minimize the local tps. They can still do so to minimize the prepayment but they would be charged the fair final tps fee when their transaction stabilizes.

### Current TPS and temp-rejects
There is still a risk that users manipulate their local tps fee by attaching to an old part of the DAG, turn their tps fee balance negative, and abandon the address (because it was drained to 0) without repaying the tps fee debt. This could allow them to spam the network without paying for the load in full. 

To minimize this risk, nodes may temp-reject transactions that carry a high risk of underpaying the actual tps fee. They do so by estimating the future final tps based on the current tps, which cannot be manipulated. However, the current tps is a subjective measure of each node that depends on its current syncing state. Current tps as seen by different nodes might vary among nodes at any given moment and at the time the given transaction starts to be processed by the validating node. This is especially likely if a node works near its full capacity and might be lagging behind other nodes. In such cases, different nodes might make different decisions about accepting or temp-rejecting a given transaction. However, such disagreement is benign as the rejection is only temporary and the same node might accept the transaction later when its state changes.

In case a node temp-rejects a transaction, it might get stuck as it will not be able to process the children of this transaction either. If stuck, its current tps will gradually decrease (the number of unstable transactions stays the same while the time interval since the last stable transaction grows) and at some point it will become lower than the tps fee paid by the formerly rejected transaction, and a new attempt to process the transaction (if it's retried) will succeed. So, this mechanism is self-correcting.

It is in the best interest of nodes to avoid including potentially underpaying transactions as parents in their new transactions. If any of such parents is temp-rejected by some nodes, these nodes won't be able (at least temporarily) to process the child transaction either. For this reason, the nodes might choose not to pick such transactions as parents and apply stricter criteria to them. E.g. if 150% of the current tps fee is enough to accept a transaction, the node might require 300% to parent it. Transactions that happen to be between the two thresholds might be accepted but not parented, at least for some time. If someone else parents such a transaction, it ceases to be a parent candidate.

### Governance
The proposed initial values of `base_tps_fee`, `tps_interval`, and `tps_fee_multiplier` look reasonable for the current implementation of node software and typical hardware it runs on. If any of those change in the future, or if the community sees that some other values of these parameters might serve the network better, the community can vote to change them.

## Backwards compatibility

It is a breaking change and all nodes will have to upgrade before the upgrade MCI as indicated in rule 15.
