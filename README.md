# OIPs
Obyte Improvement Proposals


People wishing to submit OIPs, first should propose their idea or document to the [Obyte Discord](http://discord.obyte.org). After discussion they should create a pull request to this git repository with the proposed OIP. After copy-editing and acceptance, it will be published here.

We are fairly liberal with approving OIPs, and try not to be too involved in decision making on behalf of the community. The exception is in very rare cases of dispute resolution when a decision is contentious and cannot be agreed upon. In those cases, the conservative option will always be preferred.

Having a BBIP here does not make it a formally accepted standard until its status becomes Final or Active.
